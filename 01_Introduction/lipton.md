### 1. Introduction

As deep neural networks are used more and more often in critical cases like healthcare and markets, the human inability to understand them has arised as a problem.
Interpretability is cited as a solution yet it seems the definition varies to the point of discordancy. The author accepts the word as referring to several concepts. Then focuses on supervised learning to ask both **what** is interpretability and **why** we need it. 

### 2. Desiderata of Interpretability Research

One of the aims here is to clearly give definitions for interpretability and one of the ways to do that is to consider the purposes or desiderata. 
Need for interpretability come up when there is a mismatch between what the model does and what we need from it. 
One source of conflict is the fact that the goal error minimization in supervised learning does not always capture more complex, real-life goals. Another source is a mismatch between offline training data and real use-cases which are often dynamic.

**2.1. Trust**

Some describe interpretability as a prequisite to trust. What is trust?
1. Confidence that the model will perform well. For a sufficiently accurate model, we can expect it to perform well and we don't need interpretability.
