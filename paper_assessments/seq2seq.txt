What is the main purpose of Seq2Seq-Vis as described in the paper?

Explain how Seq2Seq-Vis uses visualization to aid in debugging sequence-to-sequence models. What specific aspects of the model does it target?

Describe the five stages of the translation process in seq2seq models as outlined in the paper and explain how Seq2Seq-Vis interacts with each stage.

What are the main components of the visual interface of Seq2Seq-Vis and how do they contribute to model debugging?

How does Seq2Seq-Vis facilitate the exploration of 'what if' scenarios in model debugging? Give an example mentioned in the paper.

Discuss the use of attention mechanisms in seq2seq models and explain how Seq2Seq-Vis visualizes and manipulates these mechanisms for debugging purposes.

What role do nearest neighbor searches play in Seq2Seq-Vis, and how does this feature aid in understanding model decisions?

Explain how Seq2Seq-Vis can be used to examine and potentially correct errors in a seq2seq model's output.

Describe a real-world application of Seq2Seq-Vis as presented in the paper. How does the tool address challenges in that application?
