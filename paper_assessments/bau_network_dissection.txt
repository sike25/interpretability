Bau, Network Dissection: Quantifying Interpretability of Deep Visual Representations

What is the purpose of the Network Dissection framework as proposed in the paper, and how does it differ from traditional methods of evaluating neural network interpretability?

Define a 'disentangled representation' as discussed in the introduction. Why is disentanglement significant for understanding deep neural networks?

The paper utilizes a unique dataset called Broden for its analysis. Describe the composition of the Broden dataset and explain why it is suitable for the method proposed by the authors.

Explain the process of scoring unit interpretability as implemented in Network Dissection. How is the alignment of hidden unit activations with human-interpretable concepts quantified?

Discuss the impact of training iterations, dropout, and batch normalization on the interpretability of deep visual representations as found in the experiments section.

Describe the experimental setup used to validate the Network Dissection method through human evaluation. What were the key findings from this evaluation?

Hypothesis 1 and Hypothesis 2 are proposed to explain the emergence of interpretable units. Define these hypotheses and summarize how the paper's findings support one over the other.

How does the paper quantify the interpretability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and what does it reveal about the relationship between discriminative power and interpretability?

Compare the interpretability results of different network architectures such as AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGG, and ResNet as presented in the paper. What trends do the authors observe?

Based on the findings of the paper, how might one design a neural network to maximize both discriminative power and interpretability? Discuss any potential trade-offs or considerations.
