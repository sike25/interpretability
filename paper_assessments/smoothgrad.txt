Smilkov, SmoothGrad: Removing Noise by Adding Noise (2017)

What is the main challenge that the SmoothGrad method addresses in image classification?

Explain the concept of a sensitivity map as used in the paper. How does SmoothGrad improve these maps?

What is the fundamental technique employed by SmoothGrad to reduce noise in sensitivity maps?

Discuss how adding noise during both training and evaluation affects the quality of sensitivity maps, according to the paper.

Compare the effectiveness of SmoothGrad with other gradient-based sensitivity map techniques, such as Integrated Gradients and Guided Backpropagation.

How does the paper validate the effectiveness of SmoothGrad without quantitative metrics? What qualitative aspects are considered?

Explain the role of noise level (Ïƒ) and the number of samples (n) in the performance of SmoothGrad. How do these parameters affect the output?

What potential reasons does the paper suggest for noise in sensitivity maps generated by neural networks?

Discuss the implications of multiplying gradient-based values with actual pixel values when generating sensitivity maps.

What future research directions does the paper suggest to improve the interpretability of machine learning models further?
