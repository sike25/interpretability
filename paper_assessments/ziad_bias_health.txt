Ziad, Dissecting racial bias in an algorithm used to manage the health of populations

What main issue does the algorithm discussed in the paper exhibit?

Explain how the algorithm's prediction of healthcare costs instead of direct health indicators contributes to racial bias, as detailed in the paper.

What are the implications of the algorithm's racial bias for Black patients in terms of their healthcare management according to the study?

Discuss the counterfactual approach used by the researchers to measure the impact of the algorithm’s bias. What does this approach entail and what were its findings?

How did the authors use the available data to uncover and quantify racial disparities in the algorithm's predictions?

What does the term 'calibration bias' mean in the context of this algorithm, and how does it relate to the observed racial disparities?

Describe how socioeconomic factors might exacerbate the disparities caused by the algorithm, based on the paper’s findings.

What potential solutions do the authors propose to mitigate the racial bias found in the healthcare management algorithm?

How does the study differentiate between the costs predicted by the algorithm and the actual health needs of patients?

What broader lessons about algorithmic bias and its societal implications can be drawn from this study?
